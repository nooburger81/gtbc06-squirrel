How to know if you are golfing.


## Description

This was a challenge to utilize 3rd party APIs and create a weather application from scratch. 


## Usage

The plan is to come back and finish the 5-day forecast and create a search history that is clickable. But for now, enjoy in all the glory that is being able to search for current weather conditions in any city around the planet!
